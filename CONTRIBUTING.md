Thanks for your interest in the development of Delphes.

The Delphes development model is community-based. Users willing to participate are encouraged to fork Delphes Git repository and to submit pull requests for improvements and bug fixes. The Delphes core development team from the CP3 centre of the Universit√© catholique de Louvain is in charge of the maintenance, releases, and general support to users via the ticket system.

Questions, suggestions and bug reports can be made through the ticket system available on our website.
